## builder
Aside from humans, who are the most prolific and versatile builders, building behaviour is common in many mammals, birds, insects and arachnids. It is also seen in a few species of fish, reptiles, amphibians, molluscs, urochordates, crustaceans, annelids and some other arthropods. It is virtually absent from all the other animal phyla.
